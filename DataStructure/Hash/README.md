# HashTable and RB Tree
A red black tree is ordered, while a hash table is not.

The hash table works fine as long as ordering of keys is not an issue, but is completely useless once it is.

The relevance of the order is not in finding a key in particular -- hash table can do that without knowledge of order -- but in finding things in a range.
